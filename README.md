# Themzy Ebook Framework

HTML and CSS framework for ebooks

This is still the begining of the project for making one solid framework for styling ebooks.

Postulates of this framework:
1. Built with preprocessor (LESS);
2. Include printing styling for making perfect printed books;
3. Framework should be modular to exclude any unwanted modules;
4. Framework should be easy extendible;
5. Should have reasonable templating system;


NOTE: Roght now, this work is copyrighted, no usage, modifications and distribution is allowed. This is only to prevent framework outbreak before finishing! When nearly finished, we will open source it :)
